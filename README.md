# ReproUI
This Python 3(.7: `python-3.7` branch, .10: `master` branch) app shows pending 3D printing orders from a Google SpreadSheet. Originally developed to work with CREA (Club de Robótica y Electrónica @ ETSIDI, UPM) databases.

Some of the original code in `googleFlow.py` was obtained from [this example](https://github.com/googleworkspace/python-samples/blob/master/sheets/quickstart/quickstart.py)
